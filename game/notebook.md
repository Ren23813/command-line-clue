## Notes
*Use this space to record your findings and deductions...* 
Glass bottle is not a weapon. Found in the school kitchen. 
Florist is not sus. Also, old key is not a weapon. Found in school science lab. 
Letter oppener is not a weapon. Found in school gymnasium. 
The Banker is not a suspect. Found in the houses cottage. 
Walking stick was not the weapon. Found in cellar. 
The baker is not a suspect. Found in living room. 
The Inkeeper and The Tailor are not suspects. Both found in mansion. 
Clockmaker was not the criminal. Found in the Study, already checked out of the culprits list in this same notebook. Found a hint, it leads to the park

The hint leaded to a new one: the town hall. Also, found that the brass candlestick was not the weapon. 
The hint leaded to the offices inside the town hall. Found that the silverWatch was not the weapon. Thus, the murder weapon was the Bronze Trophy. 
That hint was really confusing. It leaded back to the playground, but it said that i should check the same hall again. There, the teacher was found. 
With that being known (that the teacher was not the murderer), it leads to only one conclusion... It was The Chef, using the Bronze Trophy.
However, even being the criminal found, why he did it?

Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
